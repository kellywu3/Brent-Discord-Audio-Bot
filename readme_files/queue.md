# Music Queue Tuple Linked List vs. Other Options:

- linear linked list queue (linked list with nodes)
    - designed based off of a linked list, uses tuples and `__slots__` to create an entry data structure
    - want to be able to pass in a dict to a function and have the function arrange the entries of the dict to a tuple ordered based off of an enum
    - want to find out how to check how much time and memory execution takes
        - want to test with input size 10, 100, 1000

- circular linked list queue (list with head and tail pointers)

- queue

- deque
